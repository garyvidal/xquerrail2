xquerrail2
==========

XQuerrail 2 is the latest version of the XQuerrail framework to support new functionality and take advantage of ML 6 + features including triples, High Order functions and many other features that require a break from the XQuerrail base.  XQuerrail 2 replaces all the functionality of XQuerrail(1) and should work very close to the original, where possible.
